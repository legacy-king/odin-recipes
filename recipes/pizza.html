    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <p>Pizza is one of the most popular fast foods in the world. It is often served with a variety of toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, and bell peppers.</p>
    <p>There are many different styles of pizza, including Neapolitan, Chicago deep-dish, and New York-style. Each style has its own unique characteristics and flavors.</p>
